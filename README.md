# lizFramework

Liz is a beatiful flower, symbol of the north or the destiny of the sailors in the past.

## a little more...

Liz Framework is different from others css frameworks, why? Its ideia is totaly different! Here I do not want (yet) to do and new bootstrap or a new materialize, when I started I just wanted something colorful and a grid with more columns for a more detailed work, here we use a 16 columns grid based in flexbox, but also allow a grid system based in grid too!

## How to use this framework

In the moment you open the css folder, you will see more two folders, the generals, where are all the files separeted and not minified and the min, where thare is just one file minified, let have attention in the generals only, there is where we will find what is important to us.

### grid.css

The file grid.css is where you will find the grid system, as I said based in 16 columns, but how to use it?

1. Use the class _row-flex_ in the parent tag, this is the same of _row_ in others frameworks, but here we define what kind of row we want, if you want to use a grid based row, so use _row-grid_
2. Now define how many columns you want each tag use, for that, just use flex-1, flex-2, flex-3 ... flex-15, flex-16.
Our **breakpoints** are _sm_ starting in 508px, _md_ starting in 758px, _lg_ starting in 992px and _xlg_ starting in 1252px, and for diferents screens, you will just to add these letters before the number of coluns, ex: _flex-xlg-5 flex-md-8 flex-16_ easy, right?

#### What more in grid.css?

The offset class is also avaiable and works in the same way of the offset in bootstrap (with the difference of here are 16 columns and not 12), ex: _offset-5 offset-md-2 offset-xlg-1_

What else? Here go a list with the other classes avaiable


|   Class | Explanation             |
|---------|-------------------------|
|   .flex | use display flex propert|
|   .grid | use display grid propert|
|  .block |use display block propert|
|.direction-column| use display: flex and flex-direction: column |
|.direction-column-reverse| use display: flex and flex-direction: column-reverse|
|.direction-row | use display flex: and flex-direction: row|
|.direction-row-reverse|use display: flex and flex-direction: row-reverse|
|.flex-no-wrap| use display: flex and flex-wrap: no-wrap |
|.flex-wrap-reverse|use display: flex and flex-wrap: wrap-reverse|
|.row-grid | use display: grid (and grid-gap: 30px)|
|.justify-around | use justify: space-around|
|.justify-evenly | use justify: space-evenly|
|.justify-between| use justify: space-between|
|.justify-start | use justify: start |
|.justify-center| use justify: center|
|.justify-end | use justify: end |
|.align-around | use align: space-around|
|.align-evenly | use align: space-evenly|
|.align-between| use align: space-between|
|.align-start | use align: start |
|.align-center| use align: center|
|.align-end | use align: end |
|._around | use justify: space-around and align: space-around|
|._evenly | use justify: space-evenly and align: space-evenly|
|._between| use jsutify: space-between and align: space-between|
|._start | use justify: start  and align: start|
|._center| use justify: center and align: center|
|._end | use justify: end and align: end|

_What else?_

*_We also have more classes!_* the align and jusitfy classes doesn't have a display: ... propert, but if you want to use a display with tham, you will just need to write it after the entire name, this way, ex: _center-grid, _between-flex, (this only works with the classes beginning with a underscore _, if you want to display flex or grid in a tag with the class align-evenly, for exemple, you will need to use flex align-evenly, or grid justify-center) and so on! I hope you enjoy using these classes!

### colors.css and color-variables.css

Both files are about colors and there are the same colors in them, but each of them have a different use! 
I'll begin by the color-variables.css, it has, well as the same says variables for colors! Many people don't know that is possible to declare variables in pure css, but we can! And you will can use these variables in you own code, even if they are in different files, the only requirement is to link the liz framework before your stylesheet! Nice, right?

Now in the colors.css we have these same colors, but in classes for background and the color of the font, the sintax to use a color as bg is **bg-color-name**, the very same name is used for the variables, the background and the text color! The sintax for change the text color is just to write the color name, ex:
class="**fire**", it makes the text have the color with the class="fire", or class="bg-sky" make the background in the sky color.

For using a variable, in your stylesheet, you can use something like this: background-image: linear-gradient(**var(--fire)**, **var(--sky)**); (of course, this is just a example and you can use the colors in any property you want), now i'll display all the color names, but I won't be wrinting specific for bg, text color and variables, because they have the same same, just follow the sintax I said, here them go:

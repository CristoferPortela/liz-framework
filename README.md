# lizFramework

Liz is a beatiful flower, symbol of the north or the destiny of the sailors in the past.

## a little more...

Liz Framework is different from others css frameworks, why? Its ideia is totaly different! Here I do not want (yet) to do and new bootstrap or a new materialize, when I started I just wanted something colorful and a grid with more columns for a more detailed work, here we use a 16 columns grid based in flexbox, but also allow a grid system based in grid too! But, really it is much more than that!
We are a mobile first based framework.

## How to use this framework
